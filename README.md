## More info
Having a secure password is **not** enough to keep your accounts safe online. Please remember the following tips:
- Have seperate passwords for each website.
- Keep your passwords in a secure place.
- Keep up-to-date with the latest data breaches and change your passwords regularly.
- Do not enter your information on any website that doesn't have "https://". Regular "http://" websites do not have SSL encryption.
- Only enter passwords on websites you trust and have searched for yourself (e.g. don't enter your password on a website that you clicked a link to get on to!)
